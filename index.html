    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>
      Many people around the world cannot afford healthy diets, which are very important in maintaining healthy and reducing the risk for diseases related to diet. To help us visualize the cost of a healthy diet, we plan to develop visualizations that clearly depict the cost of three different diet types in each country and compare it to the percentage of the population in each country which can afford these diets. As the subject of food, heath, and nutrition is applicable to everyone, these visualization tools can benefit anyone who is interested in learning more about the current status of affordability of healthy diets. The three types of diets we focused on were energy sufficient diet, nutrient adequate diet, and the recommended healthy diet and increase in healthiness as listed.
